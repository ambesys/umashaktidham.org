            <p class="lead">The Kadva Patidar (Kadva Patel) community traces its roots to the Saurashtra and north
                Gujarat regions of India. Over centuries the Kadva Patidars developed strong agricultural traditions,
                social institutions, and an identity shaped by family ties, temple-centered worship, and civic
                leadership. This page summarizes the community's origins, customs, migration patterns, and contemporary
                activities.</p>

            <h2>Origins and Early History</h2>
            <p>The Kadva Patidars are part of the wider Patidar (Patel) landowning community of Gujarat. Historical
                records and oral traditions indicate that Kadva Patidars settled in fertile pockets of Saurashtra and
                north Gujarat where they established villages, agrarian networks, and clan (khedut) organisations.
                Agriculture, irrigation, and village self-governance were central to their early economy and social
                life.</p>

        <section class="kp-migration mt-4">
            <h2>Migration and Diaspora</h2>
            <p>Beginning in the 19th and 20th centuries, many Kadva Patidars migrated for trade, education, and
                employment. Waves of migration took community members to other parts of India and abroad — notably to
                East Africa, the United Kingdom, and North America. In recent decades, the Kadva Patidar diaspora has
                formed community associations, temples, and cultural organisations that preserve language, rituals, and
                social support networks.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="kp-traditions mt-4">
            <h2>Culture, Festivals & Rituals</h2>
            <p>Community life centers on family, temple worship (including devotion to guardian deities like Umiya
                Mataji for many families), agricultural festivals, and life-cycle ceremonies. Major Hindu festivals —
                such as Navratri, Diwali, Holi, and Janmashtami — are celebrated with Gujarati customs: garba/dandiya
                dances, special foods, and community pujas. Weddings and naming ceremonies often follow local Patidar
                customs that emphasize family elders and community participation.</p>

        <section class="kp-organisations mt-4">
            <h2>Community Organisations & Temples</h2>
            <p>Kadva Patidar communities frequently organize into local mandals and national associations that
                coordinate temple activities, educational programs, and charitable work. Temples such as Umiya Mandir
                serve as spiritual and cultural hubs where religious services, festivals, and community events are held.
                These organisations also support newcomers and preserve language, music, and culinary traditions.</p>

                <p>Preserving Kadva Patidar heritage involves documenting family histories, supporting Gujarati language
                    education for younger generations, and recording oral histories. Local temples and community centres
                    often host lectures, exhibitions, and publishing projects to keep the community's history
                    accessible.</p>
